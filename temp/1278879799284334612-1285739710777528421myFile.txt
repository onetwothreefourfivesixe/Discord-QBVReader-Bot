Theocritus
claims
that
this
god
is
stung
by
bees
when
he
attempts
to
steal
honey,
and
he
accidentally
injures
his
mother
while
she
watches
Myrrha's
son.
This
god
sits
on
the
lap
of
Sychaeus'
widow
while
disguised
as
Ascanius,
thereby
enchanting
Dido.
He
resurrects
a
girl
who
opened
a
box
containing
Proserpina's
beauty,
though
that
girl
had
earlier
spilled
hot
lamp
oil
on
(*)
his
face.
He
eventually
fathers
Hedone,
the
goddess
of
pleasure,
after
he
marries
Psyche.
For
10
points,
identify
this
Greco-Roman
son
of
Aphrodite
who
shoots
arrows
to
induce
feelings
of
love.
